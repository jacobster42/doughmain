# Bread & Dough Troubleshooting Guide

Having dough problems? Don't panic! Most baking issues have simple solutions. Here's your systematic guide to diagnosing and fixing common bread and dough problems.

## 🍞 Dense, Heavy Bread

**Symptoms:** Bread is compact, heavy, doesn't rise properly
**Common Causes:**
- **Dead yeast** - Check expiration date, test yeast in warm water with sugar
- **Too much flour** - Measure by weight, not volume
- **Over-kneading** - Especially with stand mixers, watch for overworked gluten
- **Not enough kneading** - Dough should pass the windowpane test

**Solutions:**
- Always proof yeast before using (5-10 minutes in warm water with pinch of sugar)
- Use a kitchen scale - 1 cup flour = 120-125g
- Knead by hand 8-10 minutes, or mixer 4-6 minutes on speed 2
- Windowpane test: stretch small piece of dough thin enough to see through

## 🥨 Dough Won't Rise

**Symptoms:** Dough stays flat, no growth after 1-2 hours
**Common Causes:**
- **Temperature too cold** - Yeast is dormant below 70°F
- **Temperature too hot** - Heat kills yeast above 140°F
- **Old/dead yeast** - Store yeast in fridge, use within expiration
- **Too much salt** - Salt inhibits yeast activity

**Solutions:**
- Create warm environment: oven with light on, on top of water heater
- Use fingertip test: dough should spring back slowly when poked
- Proof yeast separately to confirm it's active
- Add salt after initial mixing, not directly on yeast

## 🔥 Bread Burns on Outside, Raw Inside

**Symptoms:** Dark crust but gummy, undercooked center
**Common Causes:**
- **Oven too hot** - Most bread bakes 350-425°F
- **Wrong rack position** - Too close to heat source
- **Loaf too large** - Takes longer to cook through

**Solutions:**
- Use oven thermometer to verify temperature
- Bake on middle rack
- Cover with foil if browning too fast
- Use instant-read thermometer: bread done at 190-210°F internal

## 💧 Sticky, Impossible to Handle Dough

**Symptoms:** Dough sticks to everything, can't shape
**Common Causes:**
- **Too much liquid** - Humidity affects flour absorption
- **Not enough flour** - High-hydration doughs need technique
- **Flour type** - Different flours absorb differently

**Solutions:**
- Add flour gradually, 1 tablespoon at a time
- Use bench scraper for handling
- Wet hands instead of flouring when shaping
- Let dough rest 20-30 minutes (autolyse) before kneading

## 🧂 Flat, Pancake-Like Results

**Symptoms:** Dough spreads out instead of up
**Common Causes:**
- **Over-proofed** - Yeast exhausted, gluten structure collapsed
- **Too wet** - Dough can't hold its shape
- **Weak gluten development** - Not enough kneading

**Solutions:**
- Don't let dough rise more than double in size
- Second rise should be shorter than first
- Add flour if dough is too sticky to hold shape
- Ensure proper kneading - dough should be smooth and elastic

## 🕳️ Large, Uneven Holes in Bread

**Symptoms:** Giant air pockets, uneven crumb structure
**Common Causes:**
- **Improper shaping** - Air pockets trapped during forming
- **Over-proofed** - Weak gluten can't contain gas
- **Temperature fluctuations** - Uneven rise

**Solutions:**
- Degas dough gently before final shaping
- Shape tightly but don't overwork
- Maintain consistent temperature during rising
- Use proper shaping technique for your bread type

## 🥖 Crust Too Thick/Hard

**Symptoms:** Crust is tough, hard to bite through
**Common Causes:**
- **Oven too hot** - Creates thick crust before inside cooks
- **Too long in oven** - Over-baked
- **No steam** - Steam creates thin, crispy crust

**Solutions:**
- Lower oven temperature by 25°F
- Check doneness with thermometer, not just color
- Add steam: pan of water on bottom rack or spray sides of oven
- Cover with damp towel while cooling for softer crust

## 🍞 No Oven Spring

**Symptoms:** Bread doesn't rise much in oven
**Common Causes:**
- **Over-proofed** - No gas left for oven spring
- **Insufficient scoring** - Crust can't expand properly
- **Oven not hot enough** - Needs initial blast of heat

**Solutions:**
- Under-proof slightly - dough should spring back slowly when poked
- Score with sharp blade or lame just before baking
- Preheat oven fully, consider starting 25°F higher for first 15 minutes
- Use steam for first 15-20 minutes of baking

## 🧪 Quick Diagnostic Tests

**The Poke Test:** Gently poke dough with fingertip
- Springs back quickly = under-proofed
- Springs back slowly = ready to bake
- Doesn't spring back = over-proofed

**The Windowpane Test:** Stretch small piece of dough
- Tears immediately = needs more kneading
- Stretches thin without tearing = properly developed

**Yeast Viability Test:** Mix yeast with warm water and sugar
- Foamy after 5-10 minutes = good yeast
- No foam = dead yeast, get fresh

## 📊 Measurement Matters

**Use a kitchen scale!** Volume measurements vary significantly:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour = 120-125g
- 1 cup bread flour = 125-130g
- 1 cup whole wheat = 130-135g

**Water temperature:**
- Yeast activation: 105-110°F (warm to touch)
- Dough mixing: 75-80°F (room temperature)
