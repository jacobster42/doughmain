## Hi, I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Data Analyst who discovered that the same analytical mindset that helps me debug code also makes me a better baker. What started as a sourdough class at King Arthur has evolved into a passion for understanding the science behind great bread.

### Why Dough Main Logic?

As a developer, I'm used to systematic approaches, testing, and iterating until something works perfectly. I apply these same principles to baking:

- **Precise measurements** (because flour ratios matter as much as code syntax)
- **Systematic troubleshooting** (dense bread has causes, just like bugs)
- **Tool evaluation** (I test baking equipment like I evaluate raw datasets)
- **Process optimization** (making great bread efficiently)

### What You'll Find Here

- **Foolproof recipes** with baker's percentages and timing guides
- **Honest tool reviews** of mixers, scales, proofing baskets, and more
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common bread problems
- **Technique tutorials** methods refined through countless batches

### My Approach

I believe great dough comes from understanding the fundamentals, having reliable tools, and following proven processes. No mystical intuition required - just good technique and the right equipment.
